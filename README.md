# Technical Interview Prep
A repo for tracking progress in preparing for my least favorite interview â€” the technical interview.

## Motivation
I absolutely suck at the technical/coding portion of my interviews. Behavioral interviews
are a breeze and usually fun for me, but the technical interview makes me want to
scream and rip my hair out (lol but seriously).
<br /> <br />
This repo will be used to keep myself responsible to continually learn 
the material. After studying for some amount of time, I hope to refactor this repo
and make it a resource for others like me who struggle with the technical interview 
and don't know where to start studying.
